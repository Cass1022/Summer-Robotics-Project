# Summer-Robotics-Project

This is our GitHit repository for our summer robotics project. Our goal is to make a small-scale Mars rover that will detect and pick up rocks.

The process is as follows:
- Capture video using webcamera (web cam type is undecided)
- Convert to black and white and apply gaussian blur to reduce noise
- Apply Sobel algorithm
